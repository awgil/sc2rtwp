- more careful injection to avoid intermittent crashes
- sig scanner implementation
- replace all hardcoded RVAs with sigs
- update to latest patch

unpacker:
- functable inserts are really slow and annoying... use std::map or something?..
- 0x15998E7: int3 treated as ret instead... right before switch jumptable
- automatically add unreachable blocks (ie not after jumpchain)
-- 0x2049c0: WinMain fiber threadproc ret block after jmp to SwitchToFiber
-- 0xB38027, 0xB4B1AF, 0xb58e4a, ...: orphan block after tail recursion jmp
-- unreachable block in powf
- better switches
-- 0x87D53B: jpt size for comp is in reg initialized long time before...
-- 0xB38ADE: switch value comparison happened *way* before...
-- 0x189A76D, 0x189c600: again more weirdness...
- entries for exports
- patching instead of injection
-- fix remapped section state checks
- print out when antidebug stuff is found
- seh: analyze unwind funclets?
- ida interop improvement - automatically import structs and sync to idb...
-- seh filters are marked as chunks of owning functions...
